# Getting Started

This guide will help you get started with Developerworks Unity SDK in minutes.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- Unity 2021.3 or higher installed
- A Developerworks developer account
- An API key

## Step 1: Install the SDK

There are multiple ways to install the SDK:

### Method 1: Using Unity Package Manager

1. Open your Unity project
2. Go to `Window > Package Manager`
3. Click the `+` button in the top left
4. Select `Add package from git URL`
5. Enter: `https://github.com/cnqdztp/Developerworks-UnitySDK.git`

### Method 2: Manual Import

1. Download the latest version from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/cnqdztp/Developerworks-UnitySDK/releases)
2. Extract the downloaded file
3. Drag the `Assets/Developerworks_SDK` folder into your Unity project

## Step 2: Configure Authentication

Before using the SDK, you need to configure authentication:

```

For more authentication options, see the [Authentication](/unity/authentication) page.

## Step 3: Create Your First AI Conversation

Here's a simple example showing how to create an AI conversation:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using Developerworks;

public class MyFirstChat : MonoBehaviour
{
    private DW_AIChatClient chatClient;

    async void Start()
    {
        // Initialize chat client
        chatClient = new DW_AIChatClient();

        // Send a message
        var response = await chatClient.SendMessageAsync("Hello, please introduce yourself");

        // Display response
        Debug.Log($"AI Response: {response}");
    }
}
```

## Step 4: Run Example Scenes

The SDK includes several example scenes to help you quickly understand the features:

1. In the Project window, navigate to `Assets/Developerworks_SDK/Example/Scenes`
