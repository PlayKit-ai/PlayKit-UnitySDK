# Installation Guide

Learn how to install and set up the Developerworks Unity SDK in your Unity project.

## Requirements

Before installing the SDK, ensure your development environment meets these requirements:

- **Unity Version**: 2021.3 LTS or higher
- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **.NET Version**: .NET Standard 2.1 or higher
- **Package Manager**: Unity Package Manager (UPM)

## Installation Methods

There are several ways to install the Developerworks Unity SDK:

### Method 1: Unity Package Manager (Recommended)

The easiest way to install the SDK is through Unity Package Manager:

1. Open your Unity project
2. Go to **Window > Package Manager**
3. Click the **+** button in the top-left corner
4. Select **Add package from git URL**
5. Enter the SDK repository URL:
   ```
   https://github.com/your-org/developerworks-unity-sdk.git
   ```
6. Click **Add**

### Method 2: Manual Installation

You can also install the SDK manually:

1. Download the latest release from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/your-org/developerworks-unity-sdk/releases)
2. Extract the package to your project's `Packages` folder
3. Unity will automatically detect and import the package

### Method 3: Asset Package

For offline installation:

1. Download the `.unitypackage` file from our releases
2. In Unity, go to **Assets > Import Package > Custom Package**
3. Select the downloaded `.unitypackage` file
4. Click **Import** to add the SDK to your project

## Verifying Installation

After installation, verify that the SDK is properly set up:

1. Open the Unity Console (**Window > General > Console**)
2. Look for a message like: "Developerworks SDK v1.0.0 initialized successfully"
3. Check that the SDK namespace is available:

```csharp
using Developerworks.SDK;

public class TestScript : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Start()
    {
        Debug.Log("SDK Version: " + DeveloperworksSDK.Version);
    }
}
```

## Configuration

After installation, you'll need to configure the SDK:

1. Create a configuration file at `Assets/Resources/DeveloperworksConfig.json`
2. Add your API credentials:

```json
{
  "apiKey": "your-api-key",
  "apiSecret": "your-api-secret",
  "environment": "production"
}
```

  Keep your API credentials secure! Never commit them to version control.
